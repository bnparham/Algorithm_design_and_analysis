# Algorithm Design and Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of algorithms that I have implemented while studying the subject of **Algorithm Design and Analysis**. The purpose of this project is to reinforce my understanding of fundamental algorithmic paradigms, data structures, and problem-solving strategies by coding them from scratch and documenting their logic and behavior.

The algorithms in this repository span multiple categories, including but not limited to:

- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Divide and Conquer**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Graph Algorithms**
- **Backtracking**
- **Brute Force Approaches**

Each algorithm is implemented with clarity, correctness, and educational readability in mind. Wherever applicable, I include time and space complexity analysis, comments, and sample usage.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on algorithmic paradigms or problem domains. For example:


## Included Algorithms (So Far)

### Dynamic Programming
- 0/1 Knapsack
- Matrix Chain Multiplication

### Graph Algorithms
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Dijkstra's Algorithm

### Divide and Conquer
- Quick Sort

_(More to be added progressively as learning continues.)_

## Goals and Learning Objectives

- To gain a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of algorithms.
- To practice translating algorithmic logic into code.
- To analyze the time and space complexities of classic algorithms.
- To prepare for technical interviews and academic assessments.
- To build a personal reference library of algorithm implementations.

## Usage

All implementations are written in **Python 3.x**. To run any script, simply navigate to the relevant folder and execute the file:

```bash
python knapsack_01.py
